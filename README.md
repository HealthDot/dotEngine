#### Abstract: 
We appreciate your time in reviewing the HealthDOT white paper. The HealthDOT platform exploits blockchain technology and dynamic NFTs to establish a patient-centric electronic health record system, maintaining a single, immutable version of patient data. HealthDOT empowers users with the ability to selectively authorize healthcare providers, insurance companies, and research institutions to access their personal health data. Moreover, the platform facilitates a trustless and transparent process for recording interactions, securely stored on a decentralized blockchain. Associated dynamic NFTs, implemented using the ink! smart contract language on the Substrate framework, enables seamless data interoperability. HealthDOT also offers a development platform for innovative health solutions, allowing users to access various services by leveraging their medical data. This white paper outlines our vision and the current challenges in healthcare. It provides a succinct overview of the technology deployed, and how HealthDOT aims to address specific issues to improve healthcare outcomes universally.
